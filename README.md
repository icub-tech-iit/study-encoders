## 🧭 Overview  

This repository focuses on the **study, analysis, and development of encoder technologies** used in robotic systems and experimental setups.  
It includes investigations on both **encoders currently installed on robots** and **new encoder models** being evaluated for potential integration into future robotic platforms or laboratory test setups.

## 📂 Repository Contents  

- 📝 **General** — Documentation of activities, test procedures, and experimental results.  
- 🧮 **Data analysis scripts** — Tools and scripts for processing raw data, evaluating performance, and generating plots or metrics.  
- 📊 **Key datasets** — Collections of representative or critical measurements obtained during experiments.  
- 🧰 **Simulation branch** — Contains models and scripts used to simulate encoder behavior under different conditions.  
- ⚙️ **Mechanical design branch** — Includes CAD files and mechanical components developed for the experimental setups.

## 🎯 Purpose  

The goal of this repository is to provide a structured workspace for:  
- 🔍 Comparing different encoder technologies.  
- 📈 Supporting data-driven evaluation of encoder performance.  
- 🤖 Facilitating the integration of new encoders into robotic or experimental systems.

## 🚀 Getting Started  

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/icub-tech-iit/study-encoders.git
   cd study-encoders

2.  How to clone specific branches locally
```console
git clone https://github.com/icub-tech-iit/encoders-study.git --single-branch --branch <branch-name>
```

Be careful that some branches (e.g., `master`, `mech`...) are handled via [Git LFS](https://help.github.com/en/articles/installing-git-large-file-storage).

3. [Compile the single application in the `code` branch](https://github.com/icub-tech-iit/study-encoders/blob/code/README.md)
