This data folder contains experimental data utilized to test the "MultiJoint_Setup_Analysis_Script" script, which is linked to [this issue](https://github.com/icub-tech-iit/study-encoders/issues/38).
The experimental data are:

- m20_ferrite: real data retrieved from the small joint setup. It has one joint.
- synthetic_data: fake raw data.
- twoEnc_OneFake_working_test: real data retrieved from the small setup. It has two joints (the first one is a real joint and the second one is a simulated joint, utilized to retrieve data from three different encoders).
